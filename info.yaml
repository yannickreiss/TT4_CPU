  wokwi_id:    0        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 3.0

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      It takes input 1 to determine operator and two 3 bit inputs as operands. The result is put to output 0-5.
      In multiplication mode it just outputs the number binary encoded.
      In division mode the output pins 0-2 are the quotient and 3-5 are the reminder.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Connect input 1-7 with switches and output 0-6 with leds.
